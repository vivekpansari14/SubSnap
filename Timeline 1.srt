1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:00,200
Is

2
0:00:00,200 --> 0:00:00,640
the product

3
0:00:00,640 --> 0:00:03,080
interesting? Totally

4
0:00:03,080 --> 0:00:03,919
subjective. They

5
0:00:03,919 --> 0:00:04,200
will

6
0:00:04,200 --> 0:00:04,540
not know

7
0:00:04,540 --> 0:00:04,860
the answer

8
0:00:04,860 --> 0:00:05,219
to that.

9
0:00:05,400 --> 0:00:05,599
How

10
0:00:05,599 --> 0:00:05,700
do

11
0:00:05,700 --> 0:00:06,019
you define

12
0:00:06,019 --> 0:00:07,559
interesting? Something

13
0:00:07,559 --> 0:00:08,099
new about

14
0:00:08,099 --> 0:00:08,300
it,

15
0:00:08,339 --> 0:00:08,599
is something

16
0:00:08,599 --> 0:00:09,279
advanced about

17
0:00:09,279 --> 0:00:09,480
it,

18
0:00:09,519 --> 0:00:09,880
is something,

19
0:00:10,759 --> 0:00:11,099
do I

20
0:00:11,099 --> 0:00:11,400
think it's

21
0:00:11,400 --> 0:00:11,480
gonna

22
0:00:11,480 --> 0:00:11,919
be popular?

23
0:00:12,199 --> 0:00:12,380
Do I

24
0:00:12,380 --> 0:00:12,640
think it's

25
0:00:12,640 --> 0:00:13,140
gonna flop?

26
0:00:13,619 --> 0:00:13,839
A lot

27
0:00:13,839 --> 0:00:14,140
of products

28
0:00:14,140 --> 0:00:14,380
are just

29
0:00:14,380 --> 0:00:14,560
kind

30
0:00:14,560 --> 0:00:15,019
of mid.

31
0:00:15,819 --> 0:00:16,620
Actually, most

32
0:00:16,620 --> 0:00:17,019
products

33
0:00:17,019 --> 0:00:17,500
are kind

34
0:00:17,500 --> 0:00:17,920
of mid,

35
0:00:17,980 --> 0:00:18,339
which means

36
0:00:18,339 --> 0:00:18,699
they don't

37
0:00:18,699 --> 0:00:18,839
get

38
0:00:18,839 --> 0:00:19,219
a review.

39
0:00:19,579 --> 0:00:19,800
But

40
0:00:19,800 --> 0:00:20,059
if something

41
0:00:20,059 --> 0:00:20,640
is really,

42
0:00:20,640 --> 0:00:21,179
really good,

43
0:00:21,320 --> 0:00:21,579
oh, that's

44
0:00:21,579 --> 0:00:21,920
interesting.

45
0:00:22,219 --> 0:00:22,699
If something's

46
0:00:22,699 --> 0:00:23,100
really, really

47
0:00:23,100 --> 0:00:24,500
bad, sometimes

48
0:00:24,500 --> 0:00:25,179
that's interesting

49
0:00:25,179 --> 0:00:25,420
too.

50
0:00:25,879 --> 0:00:26,100
So

51
0:00:26,100 --> 0:00:26,399

52
0:00:26,399 --> 0:00:26,579

0:00:26,899 --> 0:00:27,179
what

55
0:00:27,179 --> 0:00:28,120
is actually

56
0:00:28,120 --> 0:00:29,160
interesting about

57
0:00:29,160 --> 0:00:29,539
a product.

58
0:00:30,100 --> 0:00:30,579
That's kind

59
0:00:30,579 --> 0:00:30,820

60
0:00:30,820 --> 0:00:31,199

61
0:00:31,579 --> 0:00:31,660
And then

62
